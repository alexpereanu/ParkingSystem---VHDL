# ParkingSystem---VHDL
In this Word Document you'll find screenshots with code and description

Design of an intelligent parking filling monitoring system organized as a rectangle with an even number of places. The system has a display and controls two inputs / outputs. Each input / output has 2 optical sensors positioned so as to allow the detection of the direction of travel of the machine (by order of activation) and its presence and not smaller bodies (by simultaneous activation).
Initially our system is in an inactive state. Once the Reset button is activated, it reaches a known state and from here on it starts working, which does its job. This Reset button has the role of initiating, starting the system.
